# ECE-454-Project
Repository for ECE 454 capstone project.

Project ideas:
 - custom soundboard generator
 - Do an explore near me app. People enter how much time they have, and a mode of transport (walk/bike/car/bus) and we show a map with a radius that they can reasonably explore with some points of interest (tag stuff with what you are looking for.... food/outdoors/stores etc.
 - Do a "Recommended semester app" Uses the curriculum from a major, you tell it what classes you have taken, and what ones you liked best and it makes recommendations on what you need to take / should take for electives.
 - Could make our own "password locker" app. Have it generate passwords and let your store them on your phone behind a single master password/email... Make a web database and be able to retrieve in browser as well... (Obviously this is not something we would put actual passwords in cause security)
 - Could make a maps / dashcam app.  Lets you navigate using maps, but at the same time activates your phones cameras in like a 3 minute loop or something.  Then on a detected impact its saves the clip.
 - "Event-day parking spot finder" App to let you rent out your parking spot when you dont need it. Set rates, location etc
