<h1>Welcome to H&uacute;-mon!</h1>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To get started, tap Create H&uacute;-mon in the Menu to create your first humon! Take a picture of yourself
    or a friend, give them a name and description and come up with some moves.  If they are your first
    H&uacute;-mon, you will be able to give your H&uacute;-mon a nickname and they will be immediately added to the
    H&uacute;-mon index and your party. Any more H&uacute;-mons you create can be found in the wild.
</p>
<h2>
    Finding H&uacute;-mon
</h2>
<p>
    H&uacute;-mon can be found after you have created at least one H&uacute;-mon and have them in your party, by
    walking around Gyms and Parks. The more you walk, the more likely to find a H&uacute;-mon. If you
    tap the Map button in the menu, you can see a map with parks highlighted in light blue.
</p>
<p>
    When a H&uacute;-mon has been found, you will get a notification that you can click to enter into a battle
    with that wild H&uacute;-mon.  In the battle you try to defeat the wild H&uacute;-mon for a chance to capture
    them and add them to you party.  If the wild H&uacute;-mon is a bit to tough, or you don't think you have
    time to complete the battle, you can hit the back button to run away from the battle.
</p>
<h2>
    Adding Friends
</h2>
<p>
    From the menu, tap the Friends List Button, there you can see your current friends, and pending
    friend requests. To add a friend, all you need is their username.  Tap the add friend button and
    type in their username to send them a friend request.  Then on their device, they need to go to
    their friend requests and click your name to accept your request.
</p>
<h2>
    Fighting Friends
</h2>
<p>
    To battle your friend, make sure you both are on the app and logged in.  Then go to the friends
    list and click the name of the friend you want to battle.  Click the invite button to send them
    a battle request.  They should see a notification that they can click to accept or ignore.  Once
    they accept you will get a notification to click to enter into the battle.
</p>
<h2>
    H&uacute;-mon Index
</h2>
<p>
    The H&uacute;-mon index is where you can see information about all the different H&uacute;-mon you have encountered
    in the wild or in battle against friends.  You can see a description of the H&uacute;-mon, the moves that
    it knows, and its other stats.
</p>
<h2>
    Party
</h2>
<p>
    The party view is where you can see the H&uacute;-mon that you have captured.  You can see information
    about their health, current xp, level, and all the other information that was available in the index.
</p>
<h2>
    Hints
</h2>
<p>
    Some moves have the ability to heal an enemy. While this may seem counter-intuitive, these moves
    have a significantly higher chance of applying their effect to enemies! This does not apply to
    healing yourself.
</p>
<p>
    Fatigue sets in during battles! As the length of battles increases, Humon will
    let down their defenses and damage will increase.
