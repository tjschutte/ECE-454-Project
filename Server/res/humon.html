	                    The main premise of our app is to take yourself and your friends, and insert them into a Pokémon like game.  Then encourage users to be active and interactive with one another, through the features of the app.  The first component is to get users active by allowing them to capture new hú-mons by walking around in outdoor spaces.  In order to capture new hú-mons, users will have to battle already captured hú-mons in their party against those in the wild.  Then to be able to heal their hú-mon after a battle, users are awarded some health back for walking around.

	                <p>
	                	Hú-mon also has a social aspect to it to help encourage user interactions and maintain appeal.  Users are able to add their friends in game.  After two people are friends, they can then challenge each other to hú-mon battles to see who has the best hú-mon.
